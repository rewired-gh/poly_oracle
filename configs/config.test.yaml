# Poly Oracle Test Configuration
# 15-minute polling for testing, targeting 0-3 events per cycle.
# Single interval (poll_interval) drives: polling, detection window, persistence.

  # Volume filters (OR logic): pre-filter events before scoring
  volume_24hr_min: 25000      # $25K minimum 24hr volume
  volume_1wk_min: 100000      # $100K minimum weekly volume
  volume_1mo_min: 250000      # $250K minimum monthly volume

monitor:
  # sensitivity controls the composite signal quality threshold (0.0=permissive, 1.0=strict)
  # Formula: min_score = sensitivity² × 0.05  (window-agnostic — SNR handles scale)
  #
  # Calibration guide (5m polling, typical $25K–$1M volume events):
  #   0.3 → minScore=0.0045  — very permissive; expect 5+ alerts per cycle
  #   0.4 → minScore=0.008   — catches 5%+ moves on mid-volume markets; ~2-4 alerts/cycle (recommended)
  #   0.5 → minScore=0.0125  — stricter; only strong moves on high-volume markets pass
  #
  # Example: a 7% drop on a $500K market with stable history scores ≈ 0.22 (passes at 0.4)
  # Example: a 0.4%→0.8% tail move on a $10K market scores ≈ 0.0008 (filtered at 0.4)
  sensitivity: 0.4
  top_k: 5

  # detection_intervals: number of poll_interval periods in the detection window.
  # Effective window = (detection_intervals + 1) × poll_interval.
  # At 5m polling: 4 → effective 25m window (5 snapshots → 4 pairs for TC discrimination)
  detection_intervals: 4
